# Parking Space Counter 

*** First of all, personal vehicles are not the future. It is crucial to reduce their usage in order to mitigate the carbon footprint in our atmosphere.***

Monitoring and analyzing the occupancy of parking spaces in a parking lot can indeed offer valuable insights into the growth and activity of nearby businesses. However, the high cost associated with installing a dedicated parking count system often deters free and non-gated parking lots from pursuing such solutions. In this project, the aim is to explore the feasibility of applying machine learning techniques to count parked cars using existing surveillance videos.
